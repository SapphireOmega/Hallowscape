				CONNECTING WITHOUT APP
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Players can control their characters by using the app controls. However it is possible to
turn off the server element of the game. This results in loss of controller usage;
however, the game will still function. The players can use the WASD and arrow keys
respectively to control their characters. Q and E will function as 'attack' and 'interact'
for player one, Z and X for player two.
